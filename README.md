# CMPSC-473
My projects for ```CMPSC 473``` (Operating Systems) at The Pennsylvania State University

Fall 2022

An Operating System provides a convenient higher level abstraction of the underlying hardware to the user programs and multiplexes the hardware resources between these programs. This course introduces the four main components of an operating system in managing the processor, memory, secondary/tertiary storage and other I/O devices. The required text for this course is “Operating System Concepts” (10th edition) by Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne. Projects and exams will include all material covered in the lectures and discussions. The prerequisites for this course are CMPSC 311 (where you would have learned about operating system interfaces and system calls) and CMPEN 331 (where you would have learned how hardware components work and how to program the hardware at the low level - assembly code).
